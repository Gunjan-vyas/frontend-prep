Solution: var buildArray = function (nums) { return nums.map(item => nums[item]); };

Achieve this in constant space with map in JS Notice that you can't apply it on the same array directly since some elements will change after application

ðŸ”„ Why does it still work correctly? Because Array.prototype.map() does not modify the original array during iteration.

It creates a new array and iterates over nums as it was at the beginning of the .map() call.

This means:

nums.map(...) loops through each element once, left to right.

The nums[item] lookup always uses the original nums, not the modified one.

Even if some nums[item] values refer to indices later in the array, theyâ€™re read, not written.
